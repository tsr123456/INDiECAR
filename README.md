# INDiECAR Model Suite
This repository contains the INDiECAR model suite, a collection of three interrelated models designed to support decarbonization strategies in the cement industry. The suite includes tools for transport cost calculation, resource technology network optimization, and cost allocation for decarbonization interventions.

## Acknowledgments
The model is based on the work by Collis, Schom√§cker, et al. (INTERNAT-BT), and uses the RTN formulation (INDiECAR-RTN) described by Sunny et al. We thank the authors and organizations for their contributions to the foundational methodologies and datasets used in this work.

## Model Structure
The model suite consists of three primary components:

1. International Bulk Transport Model (INTERNAT-BT)
The INTERNAT-BT model calculates transportation costs for bulk materials over various modes of transport, such as shipping, rail, and road, to identify the most cost-effective transport options. The model uses shapefiles for European railways, shipping routes, and ports to determine the shortest paths, employing the Dijkstra algorithm and OpenStreetMap API integration for accuracy.

2. Industrial Decarbonisation Resource Technology Network Model (INDiECAR-RTN)
The INDiECAR-RTN model is based on a Resource Technology Network (RTN) formulation, which aims to minimize the total cost of cement production while achieving a specific CO2 reduction target. It considers multiple interventions, such as installing CO2 capture technologies, creating CO2 storage sites, and building infrastructure for CO2 transport. The model balances resources within each grid cell and determines the optimal technology and infrastructure choices.

3. Cost Allocator (COSTALLO)
The COSTALLO model allocates costs generated by the INDiECAR-RTN model to individual cement plants, considering the costs of CO2 transport, storage, and direct air capture. This allocation is based on the amount of captured CO2 and the distance traveled via pipelines or other transport methods.

Usage

## Running the Models
The models are structured as three separate components, each with its own Jupyter notebooks for running simulations and analyses:

### INTERNAT-BT Model:

- Navigate to the INDiECAR-BT/Notebooks directory.
- Open the relevant Jupyter notebook (e.g., transport_cost_calculation.ipynb) to compute transport costs for different feedstocks using the available shapefiles for rail, road, and shipping routes.
- Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the model and generate the results.

### INDiECAR-RTN Model:

- Navigate to the INDiECAR-RTN/notebooks directory.
- Open the appropriate Jupyter notebook (e.g., optimization_framework.ipynb) to perform optimization based on a given emission reduction target and output the least-cost decarbonization strategies.
- Execute the notebook cells to run the optimization model.

### COSTALLO Model:

- Navigate to the COSTALLO/notebooks directory.
- Open the relevant Jupyter notebook (e.g., cost_allocation.ipynb) to allocate costs from the INDiECAR-RTN model to individual cement plants.
- Run the notebook cells to perform the cost allocation.
- Running Jupyter Notebooks


## Results
The results will be saved in the Results directory of each component, including:

- Transport Costs: Computed costs for different transport modes and routes.
- Optimized CO2 Reduction Strategies: Generated by the INDiECAR-RTN model.
- Cost Allocation Reports: Distribution of costs to individual cement plants.
